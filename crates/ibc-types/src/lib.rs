//! This crate defines common data structures for Inter-Blockchain Communication
//! (IBC) messages that can be reused by different IBC implementations or IBC
//! ecosystem tooling.
//!
//! Unlike `ibc-rs`, which provides a specific and opinionated implementation of
//! IBC, `ibc-types` just defines Rust types that allow working with IBC
//! messages, allowing an IBC implementation or IBC ecosystem tooling to be
//! built on top using a common language.
//!
//! In addition to defining Rust types for IBC messages, `ibc-types` also
//! defines Rust types for IBC events, and provides code for parsing IBC events
//! to and from ABCI messages.  IBC events are de facto a critical part of IBC,
//! in that they're needed to interoperate with relayers, but are not really
//! specified anywhere.  Providing event parsing code in `ibc-types` allows IBC
//! implementations and relayer implementations to share common code for
//! producing and consuming events.
//!
//! The `ibc-types` crate is a top-level wrapper crate re-exporting the contents
//! of subcrates scoped by IBC module. For example, the `ibc-types` crate
//! re-exports the client types defined in the `ibc-types-core-client` crate, as
//! well as the types for the Tendermint light client defined in the
//! `ibc-types-lightclients-tendermint` crate.  This structure means that
//! external users of the library can use one catch-all crate, but allows
//! dependency relationships between different IBC modules. For example, the
//! Tendermint light client can depend on the core client types.  This prevents
//! cyclic dependency issues when creating new IBC light clients.
